# C Language Notes

>C Language -> Assembly Language -> Machine Code

- ### Assembler
converts assembly language code into machine language

Compiler | Interpreter
-- | --
Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code | Translates program one statement at a time
take a large amount of time to analyze the source code (overall execution time is faster) | take less amount of time to analyze the source code (overall execution time is slower)
Generates Object Code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. | No Object Code is generated, hence are memory efficient
Dubugging Difficult | Debugging Easy
E.g. C, Cpp | E.g. Python, Javascript, Ruby


## Features of C
- High level Language
- small language, 32 keywords
- core language
- portable
- built-in functions and operators
- structural language, supports modular programming
- pointers, good memory control
- extensible
- compiled language
- dynamic memory allocation
- case sensitive
- microcontroller language, system programming
- platform dependent language


## Structure of C program
- Documentation Section (Commented)
- Linking Section (Preprocessors)
- Definition Section
- Global Declaration
- Main Functions
- Other Functions (Optional)


## Execution of a C program
1) C program (source code) is sent to preprocessor first. The preprocessor is responsible to convert preprocessor directives into their respective values. The preprocessor generates an expanded source code.
2) Expanded source code is sent to compiler which compiles the code and converts it into assembly code.
3) The assembly code is sent to assembler which assembles the code and converts it into object code. Now a simple.obj file is generated.
4) The object code is sent to linker which links it to the library such as header files. Then it is converted into executable code. A siple.exe file is generated.
5) The executable code is sent to loader which loads it into memory and then it is executed. After execution, output is sent to console.

> #DEFINE PI 3.14  
>May (3) I (1) have (4) a (1) large (5) container (9) of (2) coffee (6) beans (5)

### Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal
- Base 8, 10, 16 respectively
- Octal starts with 0
- Hexa starts with 0x
- E.g. 023, 19, 0x13

### Project Ideas
- to create a decimal to hexa and octa [converter]() and vice versa

Scientific Notations in C

[Ascii Table](https://github.com/srajano/C/blob/main/ascii%20table.md)

> 5 == 5 but '5' != 53
> "5" != '5'

```
printf("%c", 97); output a
printf("%c", 97+3-1); output c

printf("%d", 'a'); output 97
printf("%d", 'c' - 'a'); output 2
```

constants in C are read only values, they cant be changed once declared and they have to be initialised while declaring

### Variables in C
- use to store values in memory
### Naming conditions for Variables
1. numbers allowed (not in beginnig)
2. Meaningful
3. alphabets and underscores are valide but no special symbols and spaces are valid
4. keywords not allowed
```
int a, b;
a = 10;
b = 103;
(or)
int a = 9, b = 103;
```
### Keyword vs Identifier in C 
Keyword | Identifier
-- | --
Keywords are predefined and specific reserved words, which hold special meaning. Keywords help in defining any statement in the program. | A particular name generated by the programmer to define a variable, structure, class, or function is called an identifier.
A keyword begins with lowercase. | In the identifier, the first character may begin with uppercase, lowercase or underscores.
It defines the type of entity. | It classifies the name of the entity.
It can only have alphabetical characters. | It can have numbers, alphabetical characters, and underscores.
It should be lowercase. | It can be both upper and lowercase.
It helps in defining a particular property that subsists in a computer language. | It helps in locating the name of the entity.
double, int, auto, char, break, and more are examples of keywords. | Test, count1, high_speed, etc are examples of identifiers.
