- ### Assembler 

converts assembly language code into machine language

Compiler | Interpreter
-- | --
Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code | Translates program one statement at a time
take a large amount of time to analyze the source code (overall execution time is faster) | take less amount of time to analyze the source code (overall execution time is slower)
Generates Object Code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. | No Object Code is generated, hence are memory efficient
Dubugging Difficult | Debugging Easy
E.g. C, Cpp | E.g. Python, Javascript, Ruby
